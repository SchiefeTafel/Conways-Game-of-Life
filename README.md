# Conways-Game-of-Life
Hi guys, this is my first github repository (never used git or github before). I've dedicated it to Conways game of life for which IÂ´ll use Java and Swing (super old). If you've got any tips on what to add, leave me a message :)

IMPORTANT: The two fonts I've included in the project are not mine, I've added the links where I got them below. I hope the two talented artists get the recognition they deserve :)
